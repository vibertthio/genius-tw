      An audio/visual interactive art piece,
      and an instrument that everyone play with
      to become a DJ + VJ. It's based on the idea of patatap,
      and using two.js, tone.js as audio and visual library.
      It combines sequencer with on concept of patatap.
      I have added some my own animation and will
      do more to replace ones from patatap.
