#####A Generative musical instrument based on the concept of map.

##About

“Beatmap” is a generative musical instrument. It consists of customized-size grid which contain directional information in each block. It connects to the whichever digital audio workstation (DAW) you are using through the software midi interface, synchronized by the clock sent from it. Player can adjust several parameters in each block, including beat number, note pitch, velocity, note duration and etc. The most important, you can rotate the direction in every block to generate a unique sequence of notes manually, or let the computer randomly create one for you.
It’s currently prototyped in Processing. Moreover, the web version is coming soon.
