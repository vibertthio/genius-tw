##About

![](./img-05.jpg)
*Iang Tu and I used “WhipWhip” in our live set. (2017.9)*


<br>

Inspired by the artist Onyx Ashanti, who exploring a new path of performance, I want to make an instrument which can detect my gesture and be the lighting device at the same time. I use Arduino as the MCU, optical fiber as light, 6-axis gyroscope as sensor, and Bluetooth protocol to communicate.
