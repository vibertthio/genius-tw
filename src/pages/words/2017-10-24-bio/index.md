#####Based in Taipei, I am major in electrical engineering in National University of Taiwan. I build a wide range of system with technology for art, design, research and performance.
#####I also make audio/visual art by using Processing(Java), C++ and Javascript, currently working on research of Tangible Web and Art Therapy studies.

##Technical & Scientific Background

In my earlier age, I was strongly interested in physics and fundamental math. I studied both hardware and software in electrical engineering, including IC design, embedded system, computer system, internet, algorithms, machine learning, and so on. Besides, I became interested in different kinds of programming language and started using them to develop my own project.


##Enthusiasm for Interdisciplinary Research

I’ve done research in different fields, such as EDA and biology. Moreover, I am working on UI/UX analysis based on a web audio/visual app that I created called “Beact”.


##Musical Soul

I’ve played guitar for over 10 years, specializing in acoustic and fingerstyle. I also produced my own electronic music pieces and hip-hop rap/beats. Furthermore, I developed several audio/visual art app, to let people with no any background have fun playing music.


##Visual Design Experience

I was a chief editor and art designer of a magazine in my university. Therefore, I am familiar with the procedure of designing, and skilled in several software.


##Live Performance

I have been to several international festivals of art and technology to perform live, like Click Festival in Denmark and Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria. The programs used in the performances were all developed by myself.


##Large-Scale Projects

In 2016, I got an opportunity to participate the art-rehab project called 《Étude》. It’s advised by Ministry of Culture of the Republic of China, sponsored by Quanta Computer. Hence, I had to not only design the system of data extraction and performance, but also coordinate with different artists and organizations.


##Spirit of Maker

Because of the courses in EE, I am good at using lots kinds of platforms and tools. I use Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and FPGA to make my own musical instruments, which often utilize gyroscope, wireless communication, lighting system, capacitive sensor, etc.
